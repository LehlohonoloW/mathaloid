# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This is a frontend web app. We generally support the latest code on the `main` branch. Please report issues against `main` unless you have a reproducible case on a specific released tag.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

- Please do not open a public issue.
- Use GitHub’s "Report a vulnerability" security advisory if available on the repository, or
- Email the repository owner via the contact address listed on their GitHub profile, or
- As a last resort, open an issue with minimal details and the label `security` asking for a private contact channel.

Include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess the impact:
- Affected page(s), browser(s), and environment
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept where feasible)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

We will acknowledge receipt within 3–5 business days and provide a timeline for a fix after triage.

## Responsible Disclosure
- Please give us a reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure (typically up to 90 days, sooner if a fix is shipped).
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that is not your own.
- Do not degrade the service or impact other users while testing.

Thank you for helping keep MATHALOID and its users safe!
