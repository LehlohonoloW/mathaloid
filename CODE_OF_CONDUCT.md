# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the MATHALOID project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:
- Using GitHub’s private reporting tools where available (e.g., Report a vulnerability/abuse), or
- Opening a confidential issue marked with the label `coc` (avoid posting sensitive details), or
- Contacting the repository owner via the GitHub profile’s listed email.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction
- Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
- Consequence: A private, written warning by community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

2. Warning
